The code editor has the `mapStateToProps()` and `mapDispatchToProps()` functions and a new React component called `Presentational`. Connect this component to Redux with the `connect` method from the `ReactRedux` global object, and call it immediately on the `Presentational` component. Assign the result to a new `const` called `ConnectedComponent` that represents the connected component. That's it, now you're connected to Redux! Try changing either of `connect`'s arguments to `null` and observe the test results.
