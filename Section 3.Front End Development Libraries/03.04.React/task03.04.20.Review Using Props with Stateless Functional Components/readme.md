The code editor has a `CampSite` component that renders a `Camper` component as a child. Define the `Camper` component and assign it default props of `{ name: 'CamperBot' }`. Inside the `Camper` component, render any code that you want, but make sure to have one `p` element that includes only the `name` value that is passed in as a `prop`. Finally, define `propTypes` on the `Camper` component to require `name` to be provided as a prop and verify that it is of type `string`.
