The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the `ReactDOM.render()` method to render this component to the page. You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use `document.getElementById()` to select the DOM node to render them to. There is a `div` with `id='challenge-node'` available for you to use. Make sure you don't change the `JSX` constant.
