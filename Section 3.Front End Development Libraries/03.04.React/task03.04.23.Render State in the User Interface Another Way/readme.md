In the `MyComponent` render method, define a `const` called `name` and set it equal to the name value in the component's `state`. Because you can write JavaScript directly in this part of the code, you don't have to enclose this reference in curly braces.

Next, in the return statement, render this value in an `h1` tag using the variable `name`. Remember, you need to use the JSX syntax (curly braces for JavaScript) in the return statement.
