In the code editor, `MyComponent`'s `state` is initialized with an array of users. Some users are online and some aren't. Filter the array so you see only the users who are online. To do this, first use `filter` to return a new array containing only the users whose `online` property is `true`. Then, in the `renderOnline` variable, map over the filtered array, and return a `li` element for each user that contains the text of their `username`. Be sure to include a unique `key` as well, like in the last challenges.
