`MyComponent` has a `visibility` property which is initialized to `false`. The render method returns one view if the value of `visibility` is true, and a different view if it is false.

Currently, there is no way of updating the `visibility` property in the component's `state`. The value should toggle back and forth between true and false. There is a click handler on the button which triggers a class method called `toggleVisibility()`. Pass a function to `setState` to define this method so that the `state` of `visibility` toggles to the opposite value when the method is called. If `visibility` is `false`, the method sets it to `true`, and vice versa.

Finally, click the button to see the conditional rendering of the component based on its `state`.

**Hint:** Don't forget to bind the `this` keyword to the method in the `constructor`!
