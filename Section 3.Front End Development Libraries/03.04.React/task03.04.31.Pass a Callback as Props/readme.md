There are three components outlined in the code editor. The `MyApp` component is the parent that will render the `GetInput` and `RenderInput` child components. Add the `GetInput` component to the render method in `MyApp`, then pass it a prop called `input` assigned to `inputValue` from `MyApp`'s `state`. Also create a prop called `handleChange` and pass the input handler `handleChange` to it.

Next, add `RenderInput` to the render method in `MyApp`, then create a prop called `input` and pass the `inputValue` from `state` to it. Once you are finished you will be able to type in the `input` field in the `GetInput` component, which then calls the handler method in its parent via props. This updates the input in the `state` of the parent, which is passed as props to both children. Observe how the data flows between the components and how the single source of truth remains the `state` of the parent component. Admittedly, this example is a bit contrived, but should serve to illustrate how data and callbacks can be passed between React components.
