In the code editor, there is a simple functional component called `ChildComponent `and a class component called `ParentComponent`. Compose the two together by rendering the `ChildComponent` within the `ParentComponent`. Make sure to close the `ChildComponent` tag with a forward slash.

**Note:** `ChildComponent` is defined with an ES6 arrow function because this is a very common practice when using React. However, know that this is just a function. If you aren't familiar with the arrow function syntax, please refer to the JavaScript section.
