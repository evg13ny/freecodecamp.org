Write both dispatches in the `handleAsync()` action creator. Dispatch `requestingData()` before the `setTimeout()` (the simulated API call). Then, after you receive the (pretend) data, dispatch the `receivedData()` action, passing in this data. Now you know how to handle asynchronous actions in Redux. Everything else continues to behave as before.
