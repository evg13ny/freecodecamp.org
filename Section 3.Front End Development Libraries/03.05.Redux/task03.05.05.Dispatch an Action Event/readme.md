The Redux store in the code editor has an initialized state that's an object containing a `login` property currently set to `false`. There's also an action creator called `loginAction()` which returns an action of type `LOGIN`. Dispatch the `LOGIN` action to the Redux store by calling the `dispatch` method, and pass in the action created by `loginAction()`.
