Write a callback function that increments the global variable `count` every time the store receives an action, and pass this function in to the `store.subscribe()` method. You'll see that `store.dispatch()` is called three times in a row, each time directly passing in an action object. Watch the console output between the action dispatches to see the updates take place.
