Declare `LOGIN` and `LOGOUT` as `const` values and assign them to the strings `'LOGIN'` and `'LOGOUT'`, respectively. Then, edit the `authReducer()` and the action creators to reference these constants instead of string values.

Note: It's generally a convention to write constants in all uppercase, and this is standard practice in Redux as well.
